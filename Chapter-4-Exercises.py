# Exercise 4-3, Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1to 20, inclusive.
# for numbers in range(1, 21):
#     print(numbers)
# -----
# Exercise 4-4 Make a list of numbers from 1 to 1 million and use a for loop to print the numbers.
# million = list(range(1, 1000001))
# for number in million:
#     print(number)
# -----
# Exercise 4-5 Make a list of the numbers from one to one millon
# Use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at 1 and ends at a million.
# Use sum() to see how quickly Python can add a million numbers.
# million = list(range(1, 1000001))
# print(min(million))
# print(max(million))
# print(sum(million))
# -----
# Exercise 4-6 Use the third argument of range() to make a list of odd numbers from 1 to 20.
# Use a for loop to print each number.
# odd = list(range(1, 21, 2))
# for number in odd:
#     print(number)
# -----
# Exercise 4-7 Make a list of the multiples of three from 3 to 30.
# Use a for loop to print the numbers in your list.
# threes = list(range(3, 30, 3))
# for number in threes:
#     print(number)
# -----
# Exercise 4-8 Make a list from 1 to 10.
# Use a for loop to print the cube of each number
# Bonus points if you use a list comprehension.
# cubes = [number**3 for number in range(1, 11)]
# print(cubes)
